## Using this project

You will need the ionic utility to build, emulate or package this project.

You can get it using npm like so:

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic
```

Then run:

```bash
$ ionic platforms add ios
$ ionic build ios
$ ionic emulate ios
```

to emulate. After building you can open the project in xcode for final
packaging as an ios application.

More info on this can be found on the Ionic [Getting Started](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started) page.

## Linting

Just run `gulp lint`
